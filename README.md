# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Objective
Create a weather dashboard using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

When I search for a city, I will be presented with today's date, current weather condition and the next 5 days' weather forecast. The current weather will tell me the UV index with colors that indicate whether the confitions are favortable, mderate, or severe. My searched city will be saved into my local storage so I can view it again without having to search for it when I open my browser the next time.
